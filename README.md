<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>My Mymeds project had a purpose, which was to help my mother account for the purchase of medicines to give to my grandfather, I could not do a project as I had planned because of lack of knowledge, so I helped my mother by making a spreadsheet in Excel for now. And today I decided to return the project, this time sales-oriented, because my girlfriend sells chocolates and sweets to collect money and she has the same problem, not having a record to facilitate sales.
I have divided this project into five parts:
* The first and final part is that of money: Where it will show the money that she has in the account, when she sells or buys some product the money will automatically increase or decrease.
*The second part is the stock: Where all the products and quantities of the same that she has to sell will appear in list form.<br>
*The third part is the sales part: Where she will be able to sell the products of the stock, in this part are 3 inputs, one with the product of the stock, another with the quantity of the sale and another with the selling price of the unit.<br>
*The fourth part is the sales record: Where each time she sells a product, the product sold along with the value of the product will be displayed to have better control over sales.<br>
*The fifth part is the refill part: Where she can increase the quantities of the product she has in stock or add new products. In this part are 3 inputs, the first which is for the name of the product (in case it already exists the quantity of the product will increase), the second is for the quantity of products and the third is for the purchase price of each unit.<br></p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can help my partner with the bussines she has and also to know new functions in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>The premise of this project is similar to the premise of the Mymeds project, to have a control of stock, of stock output, of stock entry and the control of money, only that this project has a new function which is that of sale.</p>
